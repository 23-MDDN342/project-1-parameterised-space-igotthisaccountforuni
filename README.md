### 2023 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Space
Changed idea a couple times. Now am doing a busy packing line. This means I can use more repeated elements and have a more dynamic display than my previous concept.

The fundamental movements haven't changed much but I have made it so noise is incorporated in each row.

Shading has been added along with content of each box.
