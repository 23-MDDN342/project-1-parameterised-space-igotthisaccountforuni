### 2023 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Space
As part of a creative coding course, this project was a development from the commonplace 'food gif' that I drew inspiration from originally. Changing to what it is now, its aim was to highlight the use of the arrays from the previous idea. The gif is fully scalable with its intended use as a zoom background. For this project I focused on developing my understanding of the use of arrays within for loops, and experimenting with noise and ease as their respective functions. The end result was the conclusion reached by the experimentation, noise being a key component of the colour scheme. If I were to continue this project, I would do further experimentation with the ease functions and properly incorporate it into the design.
