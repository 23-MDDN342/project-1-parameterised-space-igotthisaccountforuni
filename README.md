### 2023 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Space
I wanted to emulate the common food gifs that I have seen across the internet

Started with it being a "front scroll" base, however, I have changed to side scroll and swapped the perspective to incorporate more into the repetitions.

Frame sizes:
Normal - H540, W960
Large -
X Large -
